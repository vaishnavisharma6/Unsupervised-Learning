# Unsupervised-Learning
This repository contains python code for some unsupervised learning algorithms described below:-
1. Unsupervised Learning
   1.1 K-Means clustering for image compression: This code uses K-Means algorithm for compressing images.
   1.2 Anomaly Detection: This code uses anomaly detection algorithm to find anomalous servers(failing servers) among a given list of servers in a network.
2. Recommender Systems
   2.1 Collaborative filtering: This code is for collaborative filtering based movie recommender system using Movielens "ml-latest-small" dataset.
   2.2 Content based recommender system: This code is for content based movie recommender system using Movielens "ml-latest-small" dataset.
3. Reinforcement Learning
   3.1 State action value function: This code is for understanding state action value function and role of different parameters in reinforcement learning.
   3.2 Deep Q network for Lunar Lander: This code uses deep-Q Learning for landing a lunar lander on the surface of moon using openAI Gym library.
